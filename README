This small code base aims to provide calls to the newer file locking associated with open file descriptors, not processes, in a shared library. Open file descriptors have been available using fcntl within the recent past and in more recent versions of the linux kernel. Locks associated with file descriptors provide a long-desired and improved locking semantic across unrelated processes and even across threads within the same process. I wrote this code intending to use it elsewhere with Ocaml's Ctypes. Ocaml's Unix module does not yet, to my knowledge, provide open file descriptor locks.

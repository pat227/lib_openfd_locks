This small code base aims to provide file locks associated with open file descriptors,
not processes. Open file descriptors have been available using fcntl within the recent
past and in more recent versions of the linux kernel. Locks associated with file descriptors
provide a long-desired and improved locking semantic across unrelated processes
and even across threads within the same process.
